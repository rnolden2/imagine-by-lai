# Imagine AI Storybook

This project is a personal project I created for my daughter to help her daily 10 min read goal for school. I wanted to allow her to use her imagination and create stories that she would love to read.

## Core Features

### Story Generation
-   **User-Input Driven:** Any kid can input a simple idea or prompt for a story.
-   **AI-Powered Content:** The application uses the Google Gemini API to generate a unique, age-appropriate story (approx. 5-10 minute read time).
-   **Embedded Life Lessons:** Each story is crafted to include a positive life lesson, which can be customized by a parent.
-   **AI-Generated Illustrations:** A unique cover image representing the essence of the story is generated by AI for each story.

### Interactive Reading Experience
-   **Clickable Words:** Every word in the story is clickable.
-   **Phonetic Spelling:** Clicking a word reveals its phonetic spelling to help children sound it out.
-   **Spoken Explanations:** A button next to the word allows the child to hear a simple, easy-to-understand definition of the word spoken aloud using the browser's built-in text-to-speech capabilities.
-   **Large, Readable Font:** The story is displayed in a large, clear font suitable for early readers.

### Parent Settings & Management
A secure, parent-only section allows for complete control over the application's content and settings.
-   **User Management:**
    -   Create and manage profiles for multiple children, specifying their name, grade level, and gender.
-   **Content Control:**
    -   **Grade Level:** Adjust the reading level of the generated stories from TK to 8th grade.
    -   **Life Lessons:** Curate a list of life lessons that will be randomly chosen and woven into the stories. Parents can add or remove lessons from this list.
-   **Story Management:**
    -   View all generated stories.
    -   Delete stories.
    -   Regenerate or edit the cover image for a specific story.

## Technical Architecture

-   **Framework:** SvelteKit with Vite
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin.
-   **Database:** A local SQLite database (`imagine.db`) for storing story content, user profiles, and life lessons.
-   **AI Model:** Google Gemini for both text and image generation.
-   **Image Storage:** Google Cloud Storage for storing the AI-generated cover images.
-   **API Security:** All API calls to Google services are handled through SvelteKit server routes to protect API keys and other credentials.
